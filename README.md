# coding-quiz

## Description

This code creates a simple Javascript quiz. It can be configured with as many or few questions desired with ability to choose question and answers choices. 

It presents the user with an intro page and start button. Once the start button is clicked, a timer starts and the first question appears. The answers are presented as buttons and when an answer is clicked the next question appears while the current one disappears. If the question is incorrect, five seconds are docked from the time.

After all questions are answered, the timer stops and the score is recored as the amount of time left on the timer. If the timer hits zero before all questions are answered, the quiz will automatically end.

## Installation

This code can be used with access to html, css, and Javascript that can be run in a browser.

## Usage

The user is able to create as many questions as they'd like with the ability to choose all the text associated with the question.

The time is configurable as well as the number of seconds subtracted from the timer when an answer is wrong. 

When a user starts the quiz, they will then see each question one after the other when an answer button is chosen. The quiz will end when the timer hits zero or the user answers all the question. The score is logged as total seconds left.
